# Java-Starter
A starter repo providing examples of how to use the OpenFin Java Adapter.
This repo contains a simple Java application that uses the OpenFin Java Adapter to launch an OpenFin application.

It uses maven as the build tool and the OpenFin Java Adapter is available on Maven Central. 
Please refer to the pom.xml file for the dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the OpenFin Java Adapter and its dependencies using `mvn install`
3. Start Java-Starter, the java starter contains the main method
4. To package into a jar you can use mvn package (or the tools provided by your IDE to execute the command). 

## IDEs

You can use your own preference to build this project but we are using Visual Studio Code with Java Extensions.

## Command Line Args

This example supports the following command line arguments:

- workspaceUUID (the workspace to connect to) - If not provided then a pop up appears asking for a workspace platform uuid to be specified.
- nativeUUID (the id this app should provide to the runtime when starting up - this will be the identity seen by the platform you connect to). Defaults to "interop-test-desktop".
- registerIntents (defaults to false and changes to true if passed). Not used yet.

| [How To Listen/Transmit context](Docs/ContextSharing.md)           | This gives an example of how a Native Apps can integrate with a workspace platform (e.g. provide snapshot data from a native app to a platform, provide search results or call actions against a platform).|
